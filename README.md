# sagefiles
Sage scripts written mostly for JT project. Mostly three set of files. The first to check conjecture 5.10 in Anzis et al "Jacobi Trudi Determinants in Finite Fields" for different partition shapes and finite fields.
The second is to check a conjecture regarding hankel/toeplitz matrices. This file was used to check the conjecture proved in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.05415.pdf
Finally the third set of files is used to check the probability of a JT determinant vanishing for a fixed finite field and partition/skew partition shape. These set of files were used to conjecture and prove certain results for a paper in progres.
